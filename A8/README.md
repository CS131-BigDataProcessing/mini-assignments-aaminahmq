In this directory, we have the files preprocessing.sh shell script, and about_script.txt. The preprocessing.sh is a shell script that will automate cleaning up the  Airbnb NY dataset by identifying outliers, removing duplicate entries, and replacing missing values with "NA" in another file. To run the script, make sure that the “AB_NYC_2019.csv” file is in the folder and then run “sh preprocessing.sh”, which cleans the data and saves the output in a file called “cleaned_AB_NYC_2019.csv”. 

With each step of cleaning the dataset, we saved the data in a separate CSV file which includes remove_missing.csv,  sorted_data.txt, missing_values.csv, price_outliers.txt,  removed_duplicates.csv,  and replace_na.csv.

The about_script.txt is a text file that explains our reasoning for each task in cleaning up the data in the Airbnb NY dataset.
